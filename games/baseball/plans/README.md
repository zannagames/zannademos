# Baseball Backend Plans

This folder holds the draft plans for the baseball manager sim. The single-game backend
(plans `00`–`09`) is the foundation; the season-level layer (`10`–`15`) builds on it;
the product-level layer (`16`–`21`) expands that foundation into a full management game.

These plans assume:

- Text output only
- Backend simulation first
- Realistic baseball outcomes are the top priority
- The long-term target is closer to OOTP-style management than to an action game

The main architectural rule is simple:

- The simulation must own the truth
- Presentation must consume events from the simulation
- Manager decisions must act on stable game state, not on UI-specific code

The single-game backend (plans `00`–`09`) covers:

- How player talent is represented
- How one plate appearance is resolved
- How realism is measured and calibrated
- How balls in play become outs, hits, and errors
- How runner advancement is resolved
- How the manager interacts with the engine at safe decision points

The season-level layer (plans `10`–`15`) adds:

- Calendar, daily loop, schedule, standings, and the playoff hook
- Roster compartments and the legal transactions that move players between them
- Cross-game fatigue, injury, and availability state
- Player development, aging, and the off-season tick
- A typed manager command contract that supports both AI and human play
- Save format, persistence, versioning, and deterministic replay

The product-level layer (plans `16`–`21`) adds:

- Season-scale calibration and reporting
- Real human-manager control through the typed decision layer
- League structure, divisions, and postseason competition
- Franchise-mode economics, scouting, and player acquisition
- Historical memory through awards, records, and archived seasons
- A broadcast/watch-mode architecture that consumes simulation events without owning truth
- Franchise-shell reporting: completed-game box scores, league leaders, team stat pages,
  health/workload views, manager logs, and transaction review
