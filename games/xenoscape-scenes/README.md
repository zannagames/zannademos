# XENOSCAPE: Scenes

This is the **scene-driven recreation of Xenoscape**. It plays identically to
[`games/xenoscape`](../xenoscape/README.md) — same ten regions, same
abilities, bosses, saves, and probes — but every campaign region is an
authored `assets/scenes/region-NN.scene2d` file instead of code. The original
game's ~3,500 lines of `buildDescent()`-style level builders are replaced by a
~120-line loader (`level.zia`), and everything those builders produced now
lives in canonical scene JSON that Zanna Studio's 2D scene editor opens
directly.

## What the scenes carry

- **Tiles**: each region's full tile grid on one `terrain` layer, rendered in
  Studio through `assets/tiles/scene-tile-atlas.png` (frame `N-1` shows tile
  id `N`).
- **Tile behavior** (ADR 0176 typed sections): the complete collision list,
  hazard/surface/quicksand/conveyor/steam/save/lore/crumble/grapple tile
  properties, and the lava animation. `SceneDocument.BuildTilemap()` applies
  them, so the game has no code-side tile registry at all.
- **Objects**: every enemy spawn, pickup, interaction (switches, doors, save
  stations, shrines, teleporters, lore terminals, region gates), the boss,
  the player start, the checkpoint, and structural `marker` anchors
  (landmark/tutorial/mastery/setpiece/secret) with typed properties defined
  by `scene-components.json` (schema v13 with an enum marker kind,
  project-owned object/background/draw-stack preview profiles, a
  1280-by-720 gameplay output frame, and direct runtime-typed creation
  recipes).
- **Scene properties**: one-based campaign region, gameplay theme, and
  player-start coordinates.

`asset-library.json` tags the canonical tileset with its 64x64 grid for the
Studio asset browser.

Every enemy, gem, and upgrade the player meets is authored in the region
scenes themselves (the exporter bakes the historical enrichment pass), so
Zanna Studio edits cover the complete gameplay population; no post-load
injection runs
in code, exactly as it does in the original, so the two games remain
behaviorally identical.

## Provenance and parity

The scenes were exported from the original game's own production
`loadLevel()` path by `../xenoscape/tools/export_scenes.zia`, and
`../xenoscape/tools/scene_parity_probe.zia` proves every region matches the
code-built level **exactly**: tile-for-tile, spawn-for-spawn,
interaction-for-interaction, including built-tilemap collision, tile
properties, and animation resolution. From here on the scene files are the
source of truth — edit them in Zanna Studio, not in code.

## Run from source

```sh
./build/src/tools/zanna/zanna run games/xenoscape-scenes

# Jump straight to one region (also what Zanna Studio's Run Scene sends):
./build/src/tools/zanna/zanna run games/xenoscape-scenes -- \
  --scene assets/scenes/region-03.scene2d
```

Open `games/xenoscape-scenes` as a workspace folder in Zanna Studio
and open any `assets/scenes/region-NN.scene2d` to edit tiles, tile behavior,
spawns, and markers visually. Studio uses the scene's `region` property and the
project's preview profile to composite a fixed-time capture from the same
runtime biome renderer behind the exact tiles and objects. Its version-11
draw priorities reproduce the game's category order — pickups, player,
enemies/bosses, interactions, then editor markers — even though the canonical
scene array is grouped differently for authoring. The first-open grid default
is off, but the normal Grid control remains available. Game View fits the
authored player start inside the project's centered 1280-by-720 output frame,
locks accidental canvas navigation, and restores the exact authoring view when
closed. The **Run Scene** toolbar button launches the game at that region.
On the Object inspector tab, choose Enemy Spawn, Pickup, Interaction, Boss
Spawn, or Structural Marker and use **Create Object**. Studio creates the
correct runtime object type at the selected cell (or visible center), applies
the typed game defaults, selects it, and shows its project sprite in one
undoable edit—there is no generic placeholder or separate Add Missing step.

## Validation

The original probe suite is carried over unchanged and passes against
scene-loaded levels:

```sh
cd games/xenoscape-scenes
for probe in smoke world campaign mechanics progression meta settings \
             cadence soak ui_flow performance render playthrough \
             level_validation; do
  zanna run ${probe}_probe.zia
done
```
