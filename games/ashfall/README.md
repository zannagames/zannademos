# ASHFALL

A single-player, combat-first sci-fi FPS campaign built entirely in Zia on the
Zanna engine. Salvager **Rook Ryder** fights through nine missions on the ash
world Erebos-4 against **HELIX**, a corrupted terraforming AI, its machine army,
and three distinct bosses.

> **Scene-driven recreation:** `games/ashfall-scenes` rebuilds this
> complete campaign from Zanna Studio `.scene3d` files;
> `tools/export_scenes.zia` exports the missions and
> `tools/scene_parity_probe.zia` proves byte-exact parity with the code-built
> levels here. This original stays code-driven and untouched.

Ashfall has no product dependencies and stays cross-platform across Metal,
D3D11, OpenGL, and the software backend. Optional GLTF/GLB enemy and weapon art
ships beside procedural PBR fallback meshes, so missing assets never make the
game unplayable.

The campaign was overhauled around direct action: three-to-five-wave encounters,
clear combat state, focused mission loadouts, enemy navigation and formation
logic, explosive hazards, real progression/checkpoints, spatial audio, and
stronger lighting/feedback. Required clue, console, and collectible objectives
were removed from all nine missions.

## Running

Ashfall's interactive workload is intended for a release-mode native binary.
The bytecode VM remains useful for bounded probes, but is not a real-time game
execution target; interactive VM launches exit with the native build command
instead of opening an unplayably slow window.

```sh
# macOS/Linux, from a built Zanna checkout:
mkdir -p bin
build/src/tools/zanna/zanna build games/ashfall \
  --build-profile release -o bin/ashfall

./bin/ashfall
./bin/ashfall --windowed
./bin/ashfall --windowed --level 1

# The bounded headless smoke may still run in the VM:
build/src/tools/zanna/zanna run games/ashfall/main.zia -- --smoke
```

On Windows, use the built or installed `zanna.exe`, select an `.exe` output,
then launch it from PowerShell:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force bin | Out-Null
zanna build games/ashfall --build-profile release -o bin/ashfall/ashfall.exe
.\examples\bin\ashfall\ashfall.exe --windowed
```

Fullscreen is the default. `--windowed` forces a window, `--level 1` through
`--level 9` jumps to a campaign mission, and `--smoke` runs a bounded headless
self-check.

## Controls

| Action | Key / mouse |
|---|---|
| Move / look | WASD / mouse |
| Jump | Space |
| Sprint | Left Shift |
| Crouch / sprint-slide | Left Ctrl |
| Fire / aim down sights | LMB / RMB |
| Reload | R |
| Weapon slot | 1–9, 0 |
| Previous / next weapon | Mouse wheel or `[` / `]` |
| Throw / cycle grenade | G / Q |
| Melee | V |
| Flashlight | F |
| Interact | E |
| Diagnostics | F3 |
| Pause | Esc |

The options screen applies quality, FOV, sensitivity, invert Y, master volume,
screen shake, difficulty, flash intensity, and the high-contrast HUD live.

## Game systems

- **Combat:** ten genuinely different weapons, three grenades, melee, penetration,
  ricochets, swept projectiles, timed damage-over-time, locational damage,
  directional shields, occlusion-aware self-dangerous blasts, charge/heat,
  recoil, tracers, decals, soft particles, and dynamic light pulses.
- **Movement:** fixed-step `Character3D` acceleration, friction and air control;
  coyote time and jump buffering; physical crouching; sprint-sliding; stance-aware
  footsteps and hearing; camera sway, bob, landing, roll, shake, sprint FOV, and
  per-weapon ADS zoom.
- **Enemies:** eleven regular archetypes and three bosses with line-of-sight and
  hearing perception, NavMesh/NavAgent routing, local avoidance, deterministic
  sweep fallback, cover/flank selection, a squad token director, enemy projectile
  pools, and archetype-specific attack/defense behavior.
- **Campaign:** nine action missions, a hub, and a permanent test arena. Required
  objectives are clear, survive, or reach-after-clear. Every mission has authored
  waves, routes, landmarks, cover, flank pockets, encounter beats, pickups, and
  focused loadouts.
- **Progression:** Story/Soldier/Veteran combat scaling, a title/completion
  Armory where salvage upgrades change live weapon stats, per-level
  score/par/medals, campaign unlocks, run totals, and profile persistence.
- **Checkpoints:** Continue and Retry restore the level/wave, player transform and
  defenses, weapon ownership/ammo, grenades, objective state, score, shot stats,
  and deterministic RNG streams.
- **Presentation:** per-level skies, fog, clustered practical lighting,
  terrain/water and atmosphere; PBR materials, IBL, guarded cascaded shadows,
  SSAO/SSR and soft-particle intersections where supported, ACES tonemapping,
  a retained moving spot flashlight, instanced props, animated landmarks,
  spatially occluded procedural audio, reverb, adaptive music, and a
  resolution-aware combat HUD.
- **Performance fallbacks:** public capability checks guard GPU-only effects;
  Performance mode requests a safe reduced render scale; software/headless paths
  retain direct lighting, FXAA, fixed budgets, and deterministic behavior.

## Direct validation

The 14 portable probes can be run without ctest:

```sh
zanna check games/ashfall --diagnostic-format=json

for probe in core movement perf stress_combat combat enemy level manifest meta render campaign menu assets smoke; do
  zanna run "games/ashfall/probes/${probe}_probe.zia"
done
```

They cover compiler cleanliness, deterministic simulation, movement, budgets,
weapons/damage/audio mapping, AI/navigation/bosses, every level and hazard,
manifest round-trip, meta progression, rendering, the full nine-level campaign,
menus/accessibility/checkpoints, asset fallback, and bounded smoke execution.

The visual probe warms and captures the authored first campaign scene, then
gates center-frame luminance, lit-pixel coverage, and contrast. On macOS, the
registered CTest runs it specifically on Metal and rejects backend fallback:

```sh
ctest --test-dir build -R zia_visual_ashfall_metal --output-on-failure

# Direct run on the selected platform backend; the PNG is written to the OS temp directory.
ZANNA_3D_BACKEND=metal zanna run games/ashfall/probes/visual_probe.zia
```

For real GPU timing, build the dedicated benchmark natively. Its default mode
sweeps all nine campaign levels. `--sustained` holds a fixed twelve-enemy combat
load for 3,600 frames and reports simulation/render maxima, managed-object
growth, broadphase rebuilds, and navigation retargets. Run from the game folder
so the benchmark also loads the loose authored assets. `--fullscreen --paced`
validates native-resolution delivery at the display's actual refresh rate:

```sh
zanna build games/ashfall/probes/gpu_perf_probe.zia \
  --build-profile release -o /tmp/ashfall_gpu_perf
(cd games/ashfall && /tmp/ashfall_gpu_perf)
(cd games/ashfall && /tmp/ashfall_gpu_perf --sustained)
(cd games/ashfall && \
  /tmp/ashfall_gpu_perf --sustained --fullscreen --paced)
```

The original `misc/plans/fps/` design material was retired in the 2026-07
documentation reorganization (recoverable from git history). See
