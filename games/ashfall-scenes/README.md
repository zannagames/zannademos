# ASHFALL: SCENES

**The complete Ashfall campaign rebuilt from Zanna Studio scene files.** Every
campaign mission (1-9) and the hub load from authored
`assets/scenes/mission-NN.scene3d` / `hub.scene3d` files instead of code-side
level builders — geometry boxes are real mesh nodes with shared palette
materials and ADR 0185 collider metadata, lights are authored `SceneNode.Light`
components, and every spawn, pickup, prop, cover, flank, route marker,
landmark, encounter beat, and objective gate is a typed-metadata marker node
editable in Studio's 3D scene editor. Objectives, the water pool, ambient,
start pose, and the complete per-level environment row persist as scene root
metadata. The test arena (`--level 0`) intentionally stays code-built in
`world/arena.zia`.

The scenes were exported from the original game by
`games/ashfall/tools/export_scenes.zia`, and
`games/ashfall/tools/scene_parity_probe.zia` proves each one
reproduces the code-built level byte-for-byte through the canonical manifest
serializer (plus explicit water/objective/environment comparisons). The
original Ashfall remains untouched at `games/ashfall`.

Launch straight into one authored scene:

```sh
bin/ashfall-scenes -- --scene assets/scenes/mission-03.scene3d
```

`scene-components.json` ships the gameplay component palette (spawns, pickups,
covers, routes, gates, colliders...) for Studio's Add Missing workflow. Its 3D
preview profile maps the authored start pose and 90-degree gameplay lens,
zenith/horizon/ground sky palette, sky IBL, key/fill lights, distance and
height fog, and overlay defaults into Studio. Large missions therefore open at
player-eye scale with their runtime atmosphere and diagnostic mesh/collider
clutter hidden. It also maps every authored prop, enemy spawn, and pickup
marker to project-owned authoring art. Props and pickups use the checked-in
prefabs under `assets/editor-previews/`. Schema-v17 typed enemy-archetype rules
load the same project glTF rigs, scales, facing correction, and flying offsets
as the runtime registry. The fourteen generated enemy prefabs remain ordered
fallbacks when optional imported art is missing and for procedural-only
archetypes. Studio therefore shows the game's actual actors when available
without losing the runtime fallback contract. All of these are read-only
authoring visuals: preview loading does not add nodes to the saved mission or
change runtime instancing.
Three additional scene-level prefabs sample the runtime's deterministic
terrain formula across the same 256-meter footprint. The root `af.terrain`
value selects the canyon, ash-sea, or terrace variant, so the gameplay view
includes the runtime-generated horizon without placing derived terrain in the
mission hierarchy or save data.
Schema-v15 runtime water maps `af.wantWater` and `af.watX/Y/Z/W/D` to the
public `Water3D` surface. Mission 05 therefore previews the same full
dimensions, generated production water image, concrete normal map, 64-by-64
grid, and two wave records as the running game. Studio submits canonical
geometry, project prefabs, and transparent water in one frame while keeping the
surface out of hierarchy, picking, save data, dirty state, and history.
Schema-v16 material rules map each node's typed `surf` value to the exact
runtime surface presentation. The preview generator runs the production
`TextureLib` to bake eighteen 256×256 albedo/normal images, while the schema
retains the game values for roughness, metallic, environment reflection, SSR,
and fixed or level-colored emissive output. Studio applies those values to
temporary clones during the shaded frame and restores every canonical VSCN
material immediately afterward.
The schema also carries the balanced runtime tonemap, bloom, color-grade,
vignette, and FXAA values. Studio finalizes that retained chain before viewport
readback, giving the mission the same pale high-key atmosphere as the running
game while leaving selection and transform overlays ungraded.
Its schema-v12 1600-by-900 output frame renders that finalized scene at the
project aspect ratio, locks the gameplay camera while Game View is open, and
restores the exact authoring camera when Game View closes.
Schema-v13 creation recipes also make the gameplay templates direct authoring
actions: Enemy Spawn, Pickup, Prop, AI Cover Hint, Flank Pocket, Route Marker,
Landmark, Encounter Beat, and Objective Gate create a uniquely named node at
the viewport target with `af.kind` and every typed runtime default already
present. The project prefab preview appears in the same single undoable edit.
Box Collider intentionally remains an Add Missing-only component because it
augments existing geometry instead of creating an empty node.
Schema v18 exposes Wave 1 through Wave 4 as session-only node-preview states
over the exact integer `spawn.wave` metadata. Studio defaults each mission to
Wave 1, matching the opening encounter instead of drawing all four enemy waves
at once; **All waves** remains available for encounter-wide layout work.
Props, pickups, terrain, canonical nodes, metadata, visibility, selection, and
history are unaffected.
`materials.scene3d` seeds the project material library with the campaign's
surface-class palette. The generic contracts are documented by

and [ADR 0216](../../../docs/adr/0216-project-owned-3d-node-preview-states.md).

Regenerate the procedural fallback prefabs, water images, and surface maps
deterministically after changing production prop, enemy, pickup, terrain,
water, or material presentation:

```sh
(
  cd games/ashfall-scenes
  ../../../build/src/tools/zanna/zanna run tools/build_studio_previews.zia
)
```

`probes/assets_probe.zia` loads all 46 prefab scenes, all twelve direct enemy
model assets, both 256×256 water images, and all eighteen production surface
maps as part of the portable asset check, in addition to exercising optional
art and the complete runtime fallback path.

---


A single-player, combat-first sci-fi FPS campaign built entirely in Zia on the
Zanna engine. Salvager **Rook Ryder** fights through nine missions on the ash
world Erebos-4 against **HELIX**, a corrupted terraforming AI, its machine army,
and three distinct bosses.

Ashfall has no product dependencies and stays cross-platform across Metal,
D3D11, OpenGL, and the software backend. Optional GLTF/GLB enemy and weapon art
ships beside procedural PBR fallback meshes, so missing assets never make the
game unplayable.

The campaign was overhauled around direct action: three-to-five-wave encounters,
clear combat state, focused mission loadouts, enemy navigation and formation
logic, explosive hazards, real progression/checkpoints, spatial audio, and
stronger lighting/feedback. Required clue, console, and collectible objectives
were removed from all nine missions.

## Running

Ashfall's interactive workload is intended for a release-mode native binary.
The bytecode VM remains useful for bounded probes, but is not a real-time game
execution target; interactive VM launches exit with the native build command
instead of opening an unplayably slow window.

```sh
# macOS/Linux, from a built Zanna checkout:
mkdir -p bin
build/src/tools/zanna/zanna build games/ashfall-scenes \
  --build-profile release -o bin/ashfall-scenes

./bin/ashfall-scenes
./bin/ashfall --windowed
./bin/ashfall --windowed --level 1

# The bounded headless smoke may still run in the VM:
build/src/tools/zanna/zanna run games/ashfall-scenes/main.zia -- --smoke
```

On Windows, use the built or installed `zanna.exe`, select an `.exe` output,
then launch it from PowerShell:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force bin | Out-Null
zanna build games/ashfall --build-profile release -o bin/ashfall.exe
.\examples\bin\ashfall.exe --windowed
```

Fullscreen is the default. `--windowed` forces a window, `--level 1` through
`--level 9` jumps to a campaign mission, and `--smoke` runs a bounded headless
self-check.

## Game systems

- **Combat:** ten genuinely different weapons, three grenades, melee, penetration,
  ricochets, swept projectiles, timed damage-over-time, locational damage,
  directional shields, occlusion-aware self-dangerous blasts, charge/heat,
  recoil, tracers, decals, soft particles, and dynamic light pulses.
- **Movement:** fixed-step `Character3D` acceleration, friction and air control;
  coyote time and jump buffering; physical crouching; sprint-sliding; stance-aware
  footsteps and hearing; camera sway, bob, landing, roll, shake, sprint FOV, and
  per-weapon ADS zoom.
- **Enemies:** eleven regular archetypes and three bosses with line-of-sight and
  hearing perception, NavMesh/NavAgent routing, local avoidance, deterministic
  sweep fallback, cover/flank selection, a squad token director, enemy projectile
  pools, and archetype-specific attack/defense behavior.
- **Campaign:** nine action missions, a hub, and a permanent test arena. Required
  objectives are clear, survive, or reach-after-clear. Every mission has authored
  waves, routes, landmarks, cover, flank pockets, encounter beats, pickups, and
  focused loadouts.
- **Progression:** Story/Soldier/Veteran combat scaling, a title/completion
  Armory where salvage upgrades change live weapon stats, per-level
  score/par/medals, campaign unlocks, run totals, and profile persistence.
- **Checkpoints:** Continue and Retry restore the level/wave, player transform and
  defenses, weapon ownership/ammo, grenades, objective state, score, shot stats,
  and deterministic RNG streams.
- **Presentation:** per-level skies, fog, clustered practical lighting,
  terrain/water and atmosphere; PBR materials, IBL, guarded cascaded shadows,
  SSAO/SSR and soft-particle intersections where supported, ACES tonemapping,
  a retained moving spot flashlight, instanced props, animated landmarks,
  spatially occluded procedural audio, reverb, adaptive music, and a
  resolution-aware combat HUD.
- **Performance fallbacks:** public capability checks guard GPU-only effects;
  Performance mode requests a safe reduced render scale; software/headless paths
  retain direct lighting, FXAA, fixed budgets, and deterministic behavior.

```

## Direct validation

The 14 portable probes can be run without ctest. Run them from the game folder
so every authored `assets/...` reference resolves to this project rather than
the recovery-room fallback:

```sh
cd games/ashfall-scenes
zanna check . --diagnostic-format=json

for probe in core movement perf stress_combat combat enemy level manifest meta render campaign menu assets smoke; do
  zanna run "probes/${probe}_probe.zia"
done
```

They cover compiler cleanliness, deterministic simulation, movement, budgets,
weapons/damage/audio mapping, AI/navigation/bosses, every level and hazard,
manifest round-trip, meta progression, rendering, the full nine-level campaign,
menus/accessibility/checkpoints, asset fallback, and bounded smoke execution.

The visual probe warms and captures the authored first campaign scene, then
gates center-frame luminance, lit-pixel coverage, and contrast. On macOS, the
registered CTest runs it specifically on Metal and rejects backend fallback:

```sh
ctest --test-dir build -R zia_visual_ashfall_metal --output-on-failure

# Direct run from games/ashfall-scenes; PNG goes to the OS temp directory.
ZANNA_3D_BACKEND=metal zanna run probes/visual_probe.zia
```

For real GPU timing, build the dedicated benchmark natively. Its default mode
sweeps all nine campaign levels. `--sustained` holds a fixed twelve-enemy combat
load for 3,600 frames and reports simulation/render maxima, managed-object
growth, broadphase rebuilds, and navigation retargets. Run from the game folder
so the benchmark also loads the loose authored assets. `--fullscreen --paced`
validates native-resolution delivery at the display's actual refresh rate:

```sh
zanna build games/ashfall-scenes/probes/gpu_perf_probe.zia \
  --build-profile release -o /tmp/ashfall_gpu_perf
(cd games/ashfall && /tmp/ashfall_gpu_perf)
(cd games/ashfall && /tmp/ashfall_gpu_perf --sustained)
(cd games/ashfall && \
  /tmp/ashfall_gpu_perf --sustained --fullscreen --paced)
```

The original `misc/plans/fps/` design material was retired in the 2026-07
documentation reorganization (recoverable from git history). See
[CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) for asset licensing.
