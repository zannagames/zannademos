# ZannaSQL

ZannaSQL is a complete, PostgreSQL-compatible SQL database engine written entirely in [Zia](../../../docs/tutorials/zia-tutorial.md) — the statically-typed, object-oriented language frontend for the Zanna compiler toolchain. It is both a showcase project (demonstrating that Zia can handle serious systems-level work) and a usable database engine in its own right.

The engine implements a substantial subset of PostgreSQL SQL, including the full query pipeline from parser through optimizer to executor, a WAL-based storage layer with MVCC snapshot isolation, disk-based B-tree indexes, and a multi-user TCP server that speaks the PostgreSQL wire protocol. Standard clients — **psql**, **pgAdmin**, **ODBC drivers** — connect to it directly without modification.

It runs interpreted (via the Zanna VM) or compiled to native **ARM64 / x86-64** machine code.

**73,000+ lines** of Zia · **4,985+ test assertions** · **143** test files

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build the toolchain first
./scripts/build_zanna_linux.sh   # Linux
./scripts/build_zanna_mac.sh     # macOS

# Start the ZannaSQL database server (port 5432)
zanna run apps/zannasql/

# Connect with vsql (in another terminal)
zanna run apps/zannasql/client/

# Connect with psql (PostgreSQL client)
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U admin -d main

# Standalone REPL mode (single-user, in-memory, no server)
zanna run apps/zannasql/ -- --repl
```

Once the shell is running, you can start querying immediately:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    id      INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name    TEXT NOT NULL,
    price   REAL,
    in_stock BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
);

INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES
    ('Widget', 9.99), ('Gadget', 24.95), ('Doohickey', 4.50);

SELECT name, price FROM products WHERE price < 20 ORDER BY price DESC;
-- Doohickey | 4.5
-- Widget    | 9.99

SELECT in_stock, COUNT(*), AVG(price) FROM products GROUP BY in_stock;

SAVE 'mydb.vdb';   -- persist to disk
OPEN 'mydb.vdb';   -- reload on next run
```

### Storage & Transactions
- **MVCC snapshot isolation:** xmin/xmax row versioning — readers never block writers
- **WAL-based crash recovery:** ARIES-style redo/undo with CLRs; survives unclean shutdown
- **Disk-based B-tree indexes:** order-50 (~99 keys/page), BufferPool with LRU page cache
- **Row-level locking:** FOR UPDATE / FOR SHARE with NOWAIT and SKIP LOCKED
- **Table-level S/X locking** with deadlock-safe acquisition order
- **Persistence:** binary `.vdb` format, SQL dump (SAVE/OPEN), CSV import/export (COPY TO/FROM)
- **VACUUM / ANALYZE** for dead-row reclamation and statistics updates

### Server & Protocol
- **Database server:** `zannasql` runs as a server process with CLI configuration (`--port`, `--data-dir`, `--max-connections`, `--pool-size`, `--log-queries`)
- **vsql client:** dedicated interactive SQL client connecting via PG wire protocol, with aligned output, multi-line input, and meta-commands (`\dt`, `\d`, `\l`, `\c`, `\i`, `\timing`, `\x`)
- **Multi-user TCP server:** managed `Thread.StartSafe` workers with a bounded active-handler gate, PostgreSQL wire protocol v3 (port 5432), and simple text protocol (port 5433)
- **Extended Query protocol:** Parse/Bind/Describe/Execute for prepared statements and parameterized queries
- **Multi-database:** CREATE DATABASE, USE, DROP DATABASE; each database has its own storage file
- **Session isolation:** per-connection session state, temporary tables, transaction isolation
- **User management:** CREATE/DROP/ALTER USER (SHA-256 password hashing), table-level GRANT/REVOKE
- **Query logging:** `--log-queries` flag logs all queries to stdout with session ID
- **System views:** INFORMATION_SCHEMA, sys.* (databases, tables, stats, vacuum_stats), pg_catalog (pg_class, pg_attribute, pg_type, pg_stat_activity, pg_stat_user_tables, pg_stat_user_indexes)
- **EXPLAIN ANALYZE**, DO blocks, session variables (SET/SHOW/RESET), TABLESAMPLE
- **Compatible clients:** vsql, psql, pgAdmin, ODBC (psqlODBC/unixODBC), and any PostgreSQL v3 driver
- **Standalone REPL mode:** `--repl` flag for single-user in-memory use without starting the server

## Architecture Overview

The query pipeline goes: **SQL text → Lexer → Parser → AST → Semantic Analysis → Optimizer → Executor → Storage**. Each SELECT query walks through expression evaluation, join ordering, and predicate pushdown before hitting the storage layer. The executor is composed of modular operator nodes (scan, filter, join, aggregate, sort, limit) that form a tree — each node pulls rows from its children.

The storage engine is independent of the query layer: it manages pages, buffer pools, B-tree index traversal, and the WAL. MVCC is implemented at the row level with xmin/xmax transaction IDs; snapshot visibility is computed on read without taking locks. The TCP server runs each accepted connection on a safe managed worker, with `--pool-size` bounding the number of active handlers. See [Architecture](docs/internals/architecture.md) for the full breakdown.
